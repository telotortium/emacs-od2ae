#+TITLE: od2ae --- Convert org-drill entries to anki-editor entries

This package is for people who would like to convert their org-drill
cards to anki-editor entries to allow exporting the cards to Anki.

With this package, you can export a single card by running
=od2ae-convert-entry-to-anki=, or export everything in your agenda by
running =od2ae-convert-all-notes=.

The scheduling information will be exported in a format that can be
read by the Anki add-on
https://github.com/telotortium/anki-import-scheduling-info-from-csv
in order to transfer the scheduling info from your org-drill cards
to the corresponding Anki cards. That data will be written to
=od2ae-scheduling-info-buffer-name=, but you will need to save this buffer
yourself.
